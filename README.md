# Hello-World
Learning github with my first repository

Hey there, I am trying out this thing that is GitHub. I am not really sure what it is used for but I am finding that it can be extremely useful for orginizing and planning the growth of projects. I can use this to track coding progress and "undo" changes when need be. Further more, it is incredibly useful for finding and using others work.
